Customer Churn Prediction using Random Forest and Gradient Boosting

This repository contains code and resources for building a customer churn prediction model using machine learning techniques. Customer churn prediction involves identifying customers who are likely to churn in the future based on historical data and customer attributes.

Overview
Customer churn is a critical issue for businesses across various industries. By accurately predicting customer churn, companies can take proactive measures to retain customers and minimize revenue loss. In this project, we explore several machine learning algorithms to predict customer churn and evaluate their performance.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is "Churn_Modelling.csv", which contains information about bank customers and whether they churned. It includes features such as customer demographics, transaction history, and interactions with the bank's products or services.

Approach

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): We perform EDA to gain insights into the dataset, visualize feature distributions, and identify patterns in customer churn behavior.
Data Preprocessing: We preprocess the data to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, scale numeric features, and address class imbalance.
Model Building: We explore several machine learning algorithms, including Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Support Vector Machine (SVM), to predict customer churn. We train these models on the preprocessed dataset and evaluate their performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Model Evaluation: We assess the models' performance using techniques such as confusion matrices, ROC curves, and learning curves. These visualizations help us understand how well the models are performing and whether they suffer from issues like overfitting or underfitting.

Requirements:

Python 3.x
scikit-learn
pandas
